# This program demonstrates the use of Google's GenAI API to generate content using the Gemini model.
# It loads the API key from an environment variable, sends a prompt to the model, and prints the generated response. 
# It also supports streaming responses, which allows it to print the output as it
# is generated, rather than waiting for the entire response to be ready.

# We are importing Google's GenAI module, which is a locally installed python library.
# That library is what will connect your application to their genai web api on their servers. 
# It provides higher level function and utilities.
# Documentation:
# https://googleapis.github.io/python-genai/
